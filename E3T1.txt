# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

I ran the date hydra -l ubuntu -P rockyou.txt ssh://<YourApplicationServerDnsNameHere> command to start a brute force attack against the application server. The brute force attack was succesful and I let it run for more than 3 hrs and checked the Guard Duty next day . I was unable to find any findings in GuarDuty regarding this attack. The only finding Guard Duty seems to care about is one: Policy:IAMUser/RootCredentialUsage. I used https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_settingup.html to enable GuardDuty. Made sure that EC2 and GuardDuty are in the same region.But it didnot work. Hence I took help of a mentor and reviewed all the steps, but still I was unable to find GuardDuty findings. I am also uploading the Brute Attack and GuardDuty findings page for your reference along with the Mentor suggestions page. 

GuardDuty should have 2 findings :
- That one of my instances was being used to perform an SSH brute force attack
- That one of my instances was being attacked by an SSH brute force attack

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service which collects, analyses and processes date from Data sources like VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail management event logs, Cloudtrail S3 data event logs, and DNS logs.
The details for this attack could be found in the VPC flow logs that are being written to S3.
The logs will show a large amount of requests being sent from the one instance to a specific IP indicating that the instance is being used for an SSH brute force attack.
The logs will also show a large amount of requests sent to the other instance from a specific IP indicating that the instance is being used for an SSH brute force attack.
