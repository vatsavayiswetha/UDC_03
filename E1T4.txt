Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

Problem: Both public and private subnet network ACL rules allow all traffic on all ports from all ports.The current infrastructure is not using private subnets which expose the servers to malicious traffic.

Solution: Network ACL rules should be used to minimise the available network connectivity to reduce the traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet. This will reduce the ability for malicious actions that could be performed against the infrastructure by an attacker.

# Poor practice 2

Problem: All S3 buckets including the bucket for VPC flow logs, have no server-side encryption enabled, files were uploaded without encryption and all the buckets have block public access disabled. Currently instance role policy is set in such a way that all S3 buckets are accessible from the application server.

Solution: Policy should define the specific bucket(Free Recipe) that should be accessible from the application server. Server- side encryption should be enabled.
