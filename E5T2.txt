# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

CFRipper: Library and CLI tool for analysing CloudFormation templates and check them for security compliance.

### Example vulnerability

S3BucketPolicyWildcardActionRule: This is a rule that looks for S3 bucket policies that allow potentially harmful actions to be performed on S3 buckets.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities:

Appropriate Tools:

OpenSCAP: Security Content Automation Protoco (SCAP) enables automated vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation using a specific set of standards. OpenSCAP is an example of SCAP implementation. OpenSCAP provides a set of tools for scanning and compliance management, including oscap-docker, which can scan a container image.

### Example vulnerability:

oscap-docker lets you scan an image for xccdf (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format) compliance using the following command:

oscap-docker image <image-name> xccdf eval --report results.html --profile standard <path to xccdf definition file>

For example, to scan a CentOS image:

oscap-docker image centos xccdf eval --report results.html --profile standard /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-centos7-xccdf.xml

The resulting output will look like this:

1. Title   Disable At Service (atd)
2. Rule    service_atd_disabled
3. Result  pass
4.
5. Title   Disable Network Router Discovery Daemon (rdisc)
6. Rule    service_rdisc_disabled
7. Result  fail
8.
9. Title   Disable Odd Job Daemon (oddjobd)
10. Rule    service_oddjobd_disabled
11. Result  pass
12.
13. Title   Disable Apache Qpid (qpidd)
14. Rule    service_qpidd_disabled
15. Result  pass
16.
17. Title   Disable Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (abrtd)
18. Rule    service_abrtd_disabled
19. Result  pass
20.
21. Title   Disable ntpdate Service (ntpdate)
22. Rule    service_ntpdate_disabled
23. Result  notapplicable
24.
25. Title   Verify and Correct File Permissions with RPM
26. Rule    rpm_verify_permissions
27. Result  fail
28.
29. Title   Verify File Hashes with RPM
30. Rule    rpm_verify_hashes
31. Result  pass
32.
33. Title   Ensure Software Patches Installed
34. Rule    security_patches_up_to_date
35. Result  notchecked


##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

AWS Config: AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.

### Example vulnerability:

- s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled - Checks that your Amazon S3 bucket either has S3 default encryption enabled or that the S3 bucket policy explicitly denies put-object requests without server side encryption.
