# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

-Disable SSH password login on the application server instance.

-Restrict the IPs that are allowed to communicate to application server by providing CIDR block or exact IP address.

-Update the security group which is assigned to the web application instance. Allow connections to port 5000 from the public subnet where the application load balancer resides.


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.


- Instance Role policy should be defined using least privileged access, that the specific bucket(Free Recipe)should only be accessible from the application server instead of all S3 buckets

- Update the c3-app-InstanceRole IAM role policy to only allow read opeations to the S3 public recipe buckets (resource).


- Enable default server side encryption in the S3 bucket.
